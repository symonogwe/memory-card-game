Memory Card Game in React

Welcome to the Memory Card Game built using React! This project challenges your memory and React skills by creating a fun and interactive card-matching game.

Introduction

This project aims to create a memory card game where users can test their memory skills by clicking on cards to select them. The game logic is simple yet engaging: clicking on a card increments the score, but clicking on the same card twice in a round resets the score to 0. The game keeps track of the current score and the highest score achieved by the user.

Features

Memory Game: Click on a unique card to select it.

Scoring System: Incremental scoring for each unique card clicked.

Game Over on Duplicate Click: Reset score to 0 if the same card is clicked twice in a round.

Highest Score Tracking: Keep track of the user's highest achieved score.

React & Hooks: Utilizes React and hooks like useState and useEffect for state management while fetching data from an external API.
